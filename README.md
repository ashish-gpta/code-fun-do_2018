Earthquake rescue optimization

We help rescue agencies to decide on areas most badly affected by an earthquake by using paramaters such as:

Epicentre of the quake
Soil type of areas
Previous earth quake history
Building material Used
Structure of Building
Population/Builging density density

We would try Machine learning algorithms to train a model and optimize rescue.
