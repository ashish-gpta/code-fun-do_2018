Earthquake rescue optimization
It is observed that during any natural calamity like an earthquake, the rescue authorities are not able to identify effeciently what areas are hit the most during the 'golden hour'.
We help rescue agencies to decide on areas most badly affected by an earthquake by using paramaters such as:

Epicentre of the quake
Soil type of areas
Previous earth quake history of that area
Material Used in the Building
Structure of Building
Population/Building density

We would use these parameters to train our Machine Learning model to predict what areas would be effected the most and would require immediate attention, so that the rescue authorities can cater to the needs of the people more efficiently.
